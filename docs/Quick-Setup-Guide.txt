Part 1 - Assumptions
--------------------
This document assumes that:

- You know the RCON password for your game server
- You know the IP address and port of your game server
- You know the IP address of the computer CSBot is running on
- You have downloaded a CSBot release and extracted CSBot.EXE to some folder on your computer.
- You know which IRC server you wish to connect to, and you know its hostname (QuakeNet: irc.quakenet.org, GamesNet: irc.gamesnet.net, etc.)
- You know which channel you want to use in that IRC server
- One of the following is true:
	- (Case 1 - Internet) The game server is running somewhere on the internet, you are running CSBot on your computer with an internet connection*
	- (Case 2 - LAN) The game server is accessible on the local area network, and you are running CSBot on your computer on this network
	- (Case 3 - Local) The game server is running on the same computer that you run CSBot on

*NOTE: If Case 1 above applies to you, and you are behind a NAT router, or a firewall, then special configuration is required, as follows:
           You have to set up the firewall to allow incoming connections on a UDP port that you define(make sure to change the local port!)
           You have to set up your NAT router to forward the port you have chosen to the computer where you run CSBot.

If you are missing some information, or your server and network configuration is not covered in the cases described above, then you might want to refer to the getting-started guide or to a more in-depth documentation instead.



Part 2 - Step-by-step basic setup, Game server
----------------------------------------------

- Run CSBot.EXE
- Click on the "Connect to game server" button in the toolbar (leftmost button). This will bring up the game server connection settings.
- Fill in the details, as follows:
	- Under "Server IP/name", type in your game server's IP address
	- Under "Server port", type in your game server's port number
	- According to your case (from Part 1 of this document)
		- (Case 1 - Internet), Click "Guess Harder". This will automatically set "Local IP" to your public IP address.
		- (Case 2 - LAN), click "Guess". This will automatically set "Local IP" to your LAN's IP address
		- (Case 3 - Local), under "Local IP", type in the IP address: 127.0.0.1
	- Under "Rcon password", type in the RCON password for your server
- Click "Connect". At this point you should see the game server's log appearing in the "Raw Log" window in CSBot.



Part 3 - Step-by-step basic setup, IRC server
---------------------------------------------

- Click on the "Connect to IRC server" button button on the toolbar (second-leftmost button). This will bring up the IRC connection settings
- Fill in the details, as follows:
	- Under "Server IP/name", type in the IRC server's hostname 
	- Under "Channel", type in the channel you wish to publish in, including the # sign (for example: #MyCSBotChannel)
	- Under "Nickname", type in your bot's desired nickname
- Click "Connect". At this point, CSBot should start publishing your game on the channel.



That is it.
